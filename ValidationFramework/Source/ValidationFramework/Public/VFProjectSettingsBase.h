/**
 * A simple class which stores project wide settings which are stored in the UE Project itself.
 * These are place holders for pieces of data which allow validations to be more dynamic, in that the validations can refer to these
 * settings and use these configurable values rather than hard coded values in the validations, or require duplicate validations.
 *
 * As an example, many validations want to know what the working frame rate of a project should be, rather than have
 * each validation store this, the validations can look this up themselves from a single place of truth.
